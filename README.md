Overview
-----------------------------
This project is to create a IM tool that can be seemlessly integrated with project management tool.
First I want SimpleTalk to be able to based on topics instead of groups which is the common
approach to group a bunch of conversations which are participated by multiple persons inside the
team.  
This project is also my personal experiment. I want to test new techniques such as golang and
mongoDB. SimpleTalk is based on XMPP technology.

Depency
-----------------------------
* mgo:wrapper for mongoDB
* expat:streaming xml parser

Status
-----------------------------
This project is still in the very early stage. Nothing can be used.
